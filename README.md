## Insight Deep-Dive

### Sales Trend
**Sales Profit**

**1. High Fluctuation Q2-Q4 in 2022 – A Major Sales Anomaly**
*	Q2 (Apr-Jun) become the strongest quarter with $333 M. However, in this periode, the sales was heavily carried by April sales, in June sales started to become normal.
*	October-November 2022 Sales Profit was $33M (Previous years: $188M). This represents a ~80-85% drop from last year 2021, it should be noted that Oct-Nov was the best periode during 2021, while in 2022 it became the worst 2 month in terms of sales.


**2. Declining Growth Throughout 2022 – Indicating Weak Consumer Demand**
*	Each quarter in 2022 experienced a fluctuative trend.
*	Q1: Started fairly strong ($63M in Jan) ~400% higher than 2021.
*	Q2 – Q3:  big sales in April, July, and September, but after that the sales always dropped down into it’s normal state. This suggests customer product based-issues. TechSquare may need to re-strategize through making deals with the company product to reduce the amount of cost and gaining exclusive pricing.
*	Q4: worst of 2022, only ($14M in October and keep declining into $12M in November.


### Average Order Value
**1. AOV generally stable at low baseline, From Jan 2021 to mid 2022, AOV stayed flat with small fluctuations**
*	April 2022 has the highest AOV growth within this periode of time, peaking at $1.1M. Meanwhile, April 2021 has the lowest AOV growth with only $425K.
  
**2. 2022 AOV is higher and relatively more volatile compared to previous years**
*	Excluding the anomaly month (Sep), 2022 AOV ($861K) is better than 2021($760K).
*	September makes the AOV of 2022 become $1.09M, the AOV collapse after this periode, this is a risk, not a win.
  
**3. AOV Decline in October 2022 Indicate Anomaly.**
*	From a peak of ~$7.6M in September, AOV steadily dropped to ~$795K in October which is 89% drop.
*	In August, the AOV ~$886K, this suggest that without October being an anomaly, the AOV growth would be more stable. No “new normal” is formed, this is not scalable, retained, and did not reshape purcashing pattern.


### Order Count

<>

</p>

*	From mid-2021 to mid-2022 the quantity of unit being sold shows a clear upward trajectory, with peaks gets higher everytime, this indicates demand growth, expansion, and aggressive sales push. But still have sudden drops in every rises.
*	Total orders risen up by 46% from 2021 to 2022.
* The sales gradually declined start in April 2022, getting interrupted by anomaly period in September-2022.
* Our revenue is volume-driven, but our profit is event-driven. High sales periods do not consistently generate profit, indicating pricing and cost inefficiencies.


### Product Category Performance
**The Best and Worst**
* The Mobiles and Tables Category had a low performance sales over but in Sept 2022 the amount of customer buying this category product making it number 1 with totaling $1.3 B generating the highest revenue and it’s best performance at Sep 2022 with $528,031,420 M as it’s revenue, almost 50% of the total revenue. Even though it’s the best interms of total revenue, it’s lacking in termns of longevity.
*	The second and third best-performing products in terms of sales are the Appliance ($538,600 M total) and the Appliance ($601,77 M total). The Appliance category is the most well-balance in terms of sales and quantity ordered, if an anomaly in Sept 2022 doesn’t happened, the Appliance it the best product category.
*	The Books Category ($17 M total) had extremely low sales compared to other products category.
*	Despite being an anomaly, during April 2022, Woman fashion gain the highest profit ($143,966,094) and 32,7% of the Customer are buying this product category.

**AOV Over Time**

*	Mobiles and Tablets ($5,15M), Entertainment ($2,78M), and Appliances ($2,45M) are the biggest contributors to AOV.
*	Superstore Category have relatively low price points .They are stable but do not significantly impact AOV ($268,74K).

**Brand Performance**
This part are based on Marketing Team questions regarding particular brand (Samsung, Apple, Huawei, Lenovo, and Sony) So I exclude every product without those brands.

*	The Samsung brand had consistently strong sales year over year totaling $588,764,150, and it is the highest revenue generating product overall.
*	The second and third best-performing products in terms of sales are the Apple ($444,855,360 total) and the Lenovo ($78,341,934 total).
*	Apple ($6,447,179), Samsung ($4,716,423), and Huawei ($3,947,516) are the biggest contributors to AOV.


### Customer Behaviour

<p>

With 1984 customer with normal purchase (Register first then order) and 880 Pre-Register customer (Order first then Register), Customer segmentation is designed to reflect intrinsic purchasing behavior. Product attributes such as brand and category are analyzed post-clustering to interpret and activate each segment.

Revenue growth is driven by episodic high-value events rather than sustained customer activity.
Loyal normal customers are declining, while pre-registered customers show high potential but inconsistent engagement. This indicates strong upside with weak retention fundamentals


**Normal Customer**
*	The Loyal high value customer activity starts mid-2021, peaks around September 2021 / January-2022 with total revenue $716.79M. Units and revenue move together, After mid-2022, both collapse toward near-zero.
*	Normal but low engagement segment has very low activity early 2021 then a sharp growth mid-2021 with $27,883M in revenue. Several spiky peaks in both units and revenue, and the revenue itself sometimes spikes sometimes exceed unit growth. This means the purchases are campaign-driven, not habitual.

  
**Pre-register**
*	Extreme high volume segment has one very sharp revenue spike in April 2	022 with $237.130.190in revenue. Likely bulk or wholesale-type behavior. That spike is probably one large order, one special event, or one major customer
*	Loyal high value has almost flat for a long time. Then one massive revenue spike with minimal unit increase caused by $570.775.388 in revenue
*	Normal but low engagement showing us that the Pre-registration does not guarantee activation. Behavior mirrors low-engagement normal customers.

Normal customers contribute most of the transaction volume through repeated low-engagement purchases, providing operational stability.
Pre-registered customers, while fewer in volume, are more likely to generate high-impact purchases and bulk behavior.
This creates a trade-off between stability and upside that requires different engagement strategies per segment.

## Recommendations

**1. Reduce reliance on anomaly-driven revenue by stabilizing core product performance**
Revenue in 2022 was heavily driven by one-off events (e.g., September Mobile & Tablets spike), which are not sustainable. TechSquare should prioritize consistently performing categories such as Appliances, which show balanced revenue and unit sales, and reduce over-dependence on short-term product surges.

**2. Refine pricing, cost control, and promotions to improve profit consistency**
The revenue is volume-driven while profit is event-driven, indicating pricing and cost inefficiencies. TechSquare should renegotiate supplier pricing, limit aggressive discounts during high-volume periods, and focus promotions on improving margin, not just order count.

**3. Rebuild customer retention with segment-specific engagement strategies**
Loyal normal customers declined sharply after mid-2022, while pre-registered customers showed high-value but inconsistent behavior. Implement loyalty incentives for repeat normal customers and targeted activation campaigns for high-potential pre-registered customers to balance stability and upside.
**4. Leverage high-performing brands for bundled and upsell strategies**
Samsung and Apple consistently generate the highest revenue and AOV. TechSquare should use these brands as anchor products for bundles, cross-sells, and premium offers to lift AOV across lower-impact categories such as Superstore and Books.
